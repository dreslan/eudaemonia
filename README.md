# EudaimonAI

> *"Happiness depends upon ourselves."* — Aristotle

**EudaimonAI** is an advanced life-management system designed to guide you toward [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia](eudaimonia)—a state of flourishing and well-being. Powered by the "System AI," this application gamifies your personal growth across **8 Dimensions of Wellness**, turning the chaos of daily life into a structured, meaningful pursuit.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

EudaimonAI is built upon the **8 Dimensions of Wellness** framework to wellness described in the literature by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7hbXhs0AAAAJ&hl=en](Margaret Swarbrick) and others. The System AI analyzes your activities and helps you maintain balance, ensuring you don't max out one stat while neglecting others.

### The 8 Dimensions
1.  **🧠 Intellectual:** Expanding knowledge and skills.
2.  **💪 Physical:** Health, nutrition, and sleep.
3.  **💰 Financial:** Resource management and security.
4.  **🏡 Environmental:** Harmony with your surroundings.
5.  **🛠 Vocational:** Satisfaction and enrichment in work.
6.  **🤝 Social:** Connection and community.
7.  **🎨 Emotional:** Coping effectively with life.
8.  **✨ Spiritual:** Purpose and meaning.

### Why the 8 Dimensions?

We could have built EudaimonAI on other wellness frameworks:

- **Carol Ryff’s Six-Factor Model**
- **Corey Keyes' Flourishing**
- **Seligman’s PERMA** model. 

The thing is, all of these frameworks aim to move the user towards the same distination: holistic flourishing.

We chose the **8 Dimensions of Wellness** because it is suited for an RPG format. Unlike purely psychological models, it treats your "character" as an inhabitant of a physical world, not just a mind in a vacuum. It breaks wellness down into concrete, actionable domains—like **Financial** and **Environmental**—that translate perfectly into a quest log with measurable data.

Whether we had chosen Ryff, PERMA, or the 8 Dimensions, the goal to move "directionally" toward Eudaimonia would have been achievable, it's just that Dr. Swarbrick's framework aligns well with an RPG type setting that demands character stats and character levelling.

Additionally, the model is well cited and has been adopted in many settings (corporate, clinical).

## 🎮 System Mechanics

The System AI interacts with you through a gamified interface:

*   **Quests:** Actionable tasks categorized by dimension.
*   **Achievements:** Milestones reached through consistent effort.
*   **Physical Integration:** Generate printable cards for your achievements to store in your physical "Loot Box," bridging the digital and physical realms.
*   **The System AI:** An omnipresent guide that tracks your progress and offers "encouragement."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy
*   **AI:** OpenAI Integration

## 🚀 Initialization

To boot up the System and begin your pursuit:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eudaimonai.git
    cd eudaimonai
    ```

2.  **Start the System:**
    The `start.sh` script handles everything—setting up the Python virtual environment, installing dependencies (using `uv`), and launching both the frontend and backend.
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

3.  **Access the Interface:**
    *   **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
