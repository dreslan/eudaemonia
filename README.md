# 📢 NEW ACHIEVEMENT: The System v2.0

**Welcome, Crawler!**

The System has initialized the **8 Dimensions of Wellness** patch. You have been selected to participate in this grand experiment called "Getting Your Life Together." Try not to die.

This repository uses a holistic model to ensure you don't just max out your Intelligence stat while letting your Constitution crumble to dust. Balance is key. Neglecting a dimension may result in... *suboptimal performance*. And we wouldn't want that, would we?

## The Framework (Read this, it's important)

The "8 Dimensions of Wellness" was developed by **Dr. Peggy Swarbrick** and adopted by **SAMHSA**. It's science. You like science, right?

The model posits that wellness is not merely the absence of disease, but a conscious, self-directed process. Basically, stop being a passive NPC and start grinding.

### The 8 Stats (Dimensions)

1. **🧠 Intellectual:** Expanding your brain so you don't sound like a goblin.
2. **💪 Physical:** Activity, diet, sleep. You need hit points to survive the dungeon.
3. **💰 Financial:** Gold management. Don't be poor.
4. **🏡 Environmental:** Your lair. Keep it clean or the mobs will spawn.
5. **🛠 Vocational:** Your class/job. Find satisfaction in the grind.
6. **🤝 Social:** Party management. Don't solo everything.
7. **🎨 Emotional:** Coping with the existential dread.
8. **✨ Spiritual:** Finding meaning in the chaos.
